# **Shimizu Order Suite (Rails API)**

A multi-tenant SaaS platform for restaurant reservation and order management.

## **Overview**

Shimizu Order Suite is a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform that enables multiple restaurants to:

- Manage **reservations** and table layouts
- Take **food orders** online
- Send **notifications** via multiple channels
- Track **inventory** and **menu items**
- Sell **merchandise** with separate collection-based organization
- Analyze **business data** and metrics

The backend is built with **Ruby on Rails** in API-only mode, with a multi-tenant architecture that ensures proper data isolation between different restaurants.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

### Core Components

- **Rails API** (API-only mode)  
- **PostgreSQL** for the primary database
- **Redis** for Sidekiq job queue and Action Cable  
- **Sidekiq** for background job processing
- **Action Cable** for WebSocket communication
- **JWT Authentication** with restaurant context
- **Pundit-based Authorization** with fine-grained policy-based access control
- **Multi-tenant** data isolation through default scopes
- **CORS configuration** for restaurant-specific frontend origins

### External Integrations

- **AWS S3** for image storage
- **SendGrid** for email notifications
- **ClickSend** for SMS notifications
- **Wassenger** for WhatsApp group messaging
- **PayPal** for payment processing with SDK integration
- **Stripe** for credit card payment processing with webhooks

### Key Features

#### Order Numbering System

The platform implements a restaurant-specific order numbering system that replaces default database IDs with more user-friendly order numbers:

- Each restaurant has its own sequence of order numbers in the format `[PREFIX][COUNTER]` (e.g., "ST001")
- Daily counter reset maintains clean, consistent numbering
- Fully integrated with staff house accounts and transaction history
- See [Order Numbering System Documentation](./docs/order_numbering_system.md) for details

### Data Flow

1. **API Requests** come in through controllers
2. **Restaurant Context** is automatically applied based on JWT or params
3. **Database Queries** are automatically filtered by restaurant
4. **Background Jobs** process notifications asynchronously
5. **CORS Configuration** allows specific frontend origins per restaurant

---

## **Real-time Features**

Order Suite uses WebSockets via Action Cable to provide real-time updates to clients:

- **Order Notifications**: Instant notifications when new orders are placed
- **Inventory Alerts**: Real-time alerts when inventory items reach low stock thresholds
- **Multi-tenant Channels**: WebSocket channels are scoped to specific restaurants
- **JWT Authentication**: WebSocket connections are authenticated using the same JWT tokens as the REST API

For detailed documentation on the WebSocket implementation, see [WebSocket Implementation Documentation](docs/websocket_implementation.md).

---

## **Multi-tenant Architecture**

Order Suite uses a multi-tenant architecture where all restaurants share the same database, but data is isolated through application-level controls. This provides efficient resource utilization while ensuring proper data separation.

For comprehensive documentation on the multi-tenant architecture, see [Multi-tenant Architecture Documentation](docs/multi_tenant_architecture.md).

### Key Components of Multi-tenancy

#### 1. Restaurant Scope

All controllers include the `RestaurantScope` concern, which:
- Extracts the current restaurant from JWT tokens or request params
- Sets a thread-local variable for the current request
- Ensures all database queries are properly filtered by restaurant_id

```ruby
# app/controllers/concerns/restaurant_scope.rb
module RestaurantScope
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  
  included do
    before_action :set_restaurant_scope
  end
  
  private
  
  def set_restaurant_scope
    # For super_admin users who can access multiple restaurants
    if current_user&.role == 'super_admin'
      # Allow super_admin to specify which restaurant to work with
      @current_restaurant = if params[:restaurant_id].present?
                             Restaurant.find_by(id: params[:restaurant_id])
                           else
                             nil # Super admins can access global endpoints without restaurant context
                           end
    else
      # For regular users, always use their associated restaurant
      @current_restaurant = current_user&.restaurant
      
      # If no restaurant is associated and this isn't a public endpoint,
      # return an error
      unless @current_restaurant || public_endpoint?
        render json: { error: "Restaurant context required" }, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end
    end
    
    # Make current_restaurant available to models for default scoping
    ActiveRecord::Base.current_restaurant = @current_restaurant
  end
  
  # Override this method in controllers that have public endpoints
  def public_endpoint?
    false
  end
end
```

#### 2. Default Scopes in Models

All models that contain restaurant-specific data use default scoping to ensure data isolation:

```ruby
# In ApplicationRecord
def self.apply_default_scope
  default_scope { with_restaurant_scope }
end

# In models
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  apply_default_scope
  belongs_to :restaurant
  # ...
end
```

For indirectly associated models, custom scope methods ensure proper filtering:

```ruby
# Example for models that access restaurant through associations
def self.with_restaurant_scope
  if current_restaurant
    joins(option_group: { menu_item: :menu }).where(menus: { restaurant_id: current_restaurant.id })
  else
    all
  end
end
```

#### 3. Public Endpoints

Some endpoints need to be accessible without restaurant context (e.g., login, signup, public restaurant data). These override the `public_endpoint?` method:

```ruby
def public_endpoint?
  action_name.in?(['create', 'verify_phone', 'resend_code'])
end
```

For example, the RestaurantsController allows public access to the `show` action:

```ruby
class RestaurantsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authorize_request, except: [:show]
  before_action :set_restaurant, only: [:show, :update, :destroy]
  
  # GET /restaurants/:id
  def show
    # Skip authorization check for public access
    if current_user.present?
      unless current_user.role == "super_admin" || current_user.restaurant_id == @restaurant.id
        return render json: { error: "Forbidden" }, status: :forbidden
      end
    end

    render json: restaurant_json(@restaurant)
  end
  
  # ...
end
```

#### 4. Dynamic CORS Configuration

Each restaurant can configure its own allowed frontend origins:

```ruby
# In Restaurant model
attribute :allowed_origins, :string, array: true, default: []

# In CORS configuration
origins lambda { |source, env|
  request_origin = env["HTTP_ORIGIN"]
  
  # Check if origin is allowed for any restaurant
  Restaurant.where("allowed_origins @> ARRAY[?]::varchar[]", [request_origin]).exists? ||
  request_origin == 'http://localhost:5173' # Development exception
}
```

## **Notification System**

The system includes a robust notification framework for communicating with customers:

### 1. Notification Channels

- **Email** - Using SendGrid for transactional emails
- **SMS** - Using ClickSend for text messages
- **WhatsApp** - Using Wassenger for WhatsApp messages

Each restaurant can configure which notification channels they want to use for different types of communications:

```ruby
# In Restaurant model (admin_settings JSONB field)
{
  "notification_channels": {
    "orders": {
      "email": true,
      "sms": true
    },
    "reservations": {
      "email": true,
      "sms": false
    }
  }
}
```

The system sends notifications by default unless explicitly disabled, ensuring backward compatibility with existing restaurants that don't have notification preferences set yet.

### 2. Background Processing

Notifications are processed asynchronously using Sidekiq:

```ruby
# app/jobs/send_sms_job.rb
class SendSmsJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :notifications

  def perform(phone_number, message)
    client = ClicksendClient.new
    client.send_sms(phone_number, message)
  end
end

# app/jobs/send_whatsapp_job.rb
class SendWhatsappJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :notifications

  def perform(phone_number, message)
    client = WassengerClient.new
    client.send_message(phone_number, message)
  end
end
```

### 3. Mailers

Email notifications are handled through dedicated mailers:

```ruby
# app/mailers/order_mailer.rb
class OrderMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def order_confirmation(order)
    @order = order
    mail(to: @order.contact_email, subject: "Your order has been confirmed")
  end

  def order_preparing(order)
    @order = order
    mail(to: @order.contact_email, subject: "Your order is being prepared")
  end

  def order_ready(order)
    @order = order
    mail(to: @order.contact_email, subject: "Your order is ready for pickup")
  end
end

# app/mailers/reservation_mailer.rb
class ReservationMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def reservation_confirmation(reservation)
    @reservation = reservation
    mail(to: @reservation.contact_email, subject: "Your reservation is confirmed")
  end
end
```

### 4. Notification Tracking

The Notification model tracks all sent notifications:

```ruby
# app/models/notification.rb
class Notification < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :notifiable, polymorphic: true
  
  enum status: { pending: 'pending', sent: 'sent', failed: 'failed' }
  enum notification_type: { confirmation: 'confirmation', reminder: 'reminder', update: 'update' }
  enum delivery_method: { email: 'email', sms: 'sms', whatsapp: 'whatsapp' }
  
  # Enhanced with additional fields for better tracking
  attribute :recipient_info, :jsonb, default: {}
  attribute :message_content, :text
  attribute :error_details, :jsonb, default: {}
end
```

### Performance Optimizations

The API includes several performance optimizations to handle high traffic loads:

#### 1. Database Optimizations

- **Performance Indexes**: Critical indexes on frequently queried columns:
  ```ruby
  # Example from migration
  add_index :orders, [:restaurant_id, :status, :created_at], name: 'index_orders_on_restaurant_status_date'
  add_index :orders, [:user_id, :created_at], name: 'index_orders_on_user_created_at'
  ```

- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable database connection pool:
  ```ruby
  # In database.yml
  production:
    pool: <%= ENV.fetch("DB_POOL_SIZE", 30) %>
  ```

- **Redis Caching**: Redis-backed cache store with memory fallback:
  ```ruby
  # In production.rb
  config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, {
    url: ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" },
    error_handler: -> (method:, returning:, exception:) {
      Rails.logger.error "Redis error: #{exception.message}"
    }
  }
  ```

#### 2. Pagination

The API uses efficient pagination for list endpoints to ensure optimal performance with large datasets:

```ruby
# Example pagination implementation in OrdersController
def index
  # Get total count before pagination
  total_count = @orders.count
  
  # Apply sorting and pagination
  @orders = @orders.order(created_at: :desc)
                  .offset((page - 1) * per_page)
                  .limit(per_page)
  
  render json: {
    orders: @orders,
    total_count: total_count,
    page: page,
    per_page: per_page
  }, status: :ok
end
```

Paginated endpoints return a consistent response format:
```json
{
  "orders": [...],
  "total_count": 42,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 10
}
```
