# app/controllers/concerns/tenant_isolation.rb
# 
# The TenantIsolation concern provides a robust framework for enforcing
# multi-tenant isolation throughout the application. It ensures that
# data from one restaurant is not accessible to users of another restaurant.
#
# This concern should be included in all controllers that access
# restaurant-specific data. It replaces the previous RestaurantScope concern
# and provides stronger isolation guarantees.
